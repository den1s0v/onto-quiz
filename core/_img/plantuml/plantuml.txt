0. You can download PlantUML .jar here:
https://plantuml.com/ru/download

(jre & graphviz are also required)

1. Start plantuml.jar in current directory to regenerate *.pu diagrams (and on each change of *.pu files).


2. Here are a CMD commands to start plantuml.jar on Windows:

set GRAPHVIZ_DOT=C:\your\path\to\graphviz-2.38\bin\dot.exe

3. You can download XML style for Notepad++ to enable PlantUML syntax highlighting here:
https://github.com/brianmaher84/PlantUML_Notepad-_UDL

Choose PlantUml.xml there (PlantUML_dark.xml does not look good for me).
